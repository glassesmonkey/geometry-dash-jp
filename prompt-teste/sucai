# Move over, Midjourney — Flux just got a huge upgrade for generating AI images
Flux, the AI generation model from Black Forest Labs, is one of the best AI image generators, particularly because it’s open source and so is widely available. Now, there is a new version — and it has taken things to a new level.

Flux 1.1 Pro offers improved realism and significantly faster image creation than previous versions of Flux Pro. In my tests, I found the pro model as fast as generating lower-resolution images with Schnell, the smallest of the Flux models.

Initially, Freepik will be the only generation platform with access to Flux 1.1 Pro although it will also be available through API calls from other providers. To mark the launch Freepik is making the new model accessible to free users until the weekend.

Previously dubbed ‘"Blueberry mode" in user ranking tests, where people have to vote between two images made using the same prompt, this new model outperforms the previous generation of Flux 1 Pro, Ideogram 2 and Midjourney 6.1 — topping the leaderboard.

I was given early access to Flux 1.1 Pro and during my testing I found the new model was much better at following a descriptive prompt, reducing the need to use "AI enhancement" for prompts in the Freepik platform. The images generated also looked more natural but there were some issues around generating faces if multiple people were in the frame.

In one example I generated an image of a group of friends taking a selfie with a smartphone and the first version had several phones with people capturing their own image within the frame, rather than one person taking an image of everyone.

I did find that the speed improvements led to a drop in the impressive levels of photorealism compared to Flux 1 Pro, but that might just be a case of needing some fine-tuning.

Where will I be able to use Flux 1.1 Pro?

Black Forest Labs makes new models widely available. The exception is the Pro versions, which are largely restricted to AI platforms due to the hardware requirements to run the model. This should still be the case with Flux 1.1 Pro, but you will likely find it on many platforms.

Freepik will have Flux 1.1 Pro as part of its AI image service. It will be free initially but after Friday night it will only be available to paying subscribers. You will likely also find Flux 1.1 Pro on API-like platforms such as FAL and eventually on services like Poe, HuggingChat and NightCafe.

# flux 1.1 pro 详细介绍
黑森林实验室从今年夏天开始就在生成式 AI 领域开疆拓土了，他们接过了 stability AI 留下的 stable diffusion 的借力棒。如果你一直在关注这些模型的话，你就会知道 stable diffusion 是开源领域最大的突破之一，它是第一个证明开源技术可以做出比 Dell 或 midjourney 这些大公司更强大工具的图像模型。而今天他们又带来了新版本的 Flex 模型，继续这个使命。他们发布的 Flex 1.1 Pro 版本真的很有意思。

说话人 1 
对了，你们可能不知道这家公司的创始团队其实很多都是从 stability AI 出来的。他们继续着创造突破性的最先进的生成式 AI 模型的使命，而且要让所有人都能用上，那么这个新模型到底厉害在哪儿呢？它跟几周前神秘兮兮透露的蓝莓模型又有什么关系呢？现在在哪里可以用到这个模型呢？我们这期视频就来聊聊这些话题，让我们开始吧。

说话人 1 
几周前我们就开始听说蓝莓这个名字了，但当时大家都不太清楚它到底是什么，我们只知道这是一个很厉害的模型，性能很强，无论再大 GPU 还是小 GPU 上都能发挥出色。就像之前的 Flux 模型一样，虽然我们还没看到 Flux AI 在 AI 视频方面的完整计划，毕竟这周其他家也发布了很多厉害的 AI 视频技术，但这次的更新依然让人印象深刻。

说话人 1 
现在我们终于确定这个神秘的蓝莓模型就是黑森林实验室搞出来的，他们说要发布 Flux 1.1 Pro 和BFLAPI，这个 BFLAPI 基本上就是黑森林实验室为 Flux 1.1 提供的测试版API。待会我们再来聊聊为什么这个 API 很厉害，这是我们目前最先进、最高效的模型，同时我们也正式推出了 BF l API 的测试版，我最喜欢的是他们还在专注于提高效率，让这个模型能在尽可能多的 GPU 上运行。不管你用的是 RTX 3060，还是最新的 RTX 4090，甚至是 AE 版，这次发布是我们使命的一大进步，我们要赋能创作者、开发者和企业，让他们用上可扩展的最先进的生成技术。目前的结果真的很让人兴奋，我今天在 x 上看到了一些效果，真的太酷了，这个模型还在不断进步，我觉得现在黑森林实验室提升能力的速度都比 stable diffusion 当初还快。当然 stable diffusion 有几个月的进步速度也是疯狂的，不过现在看到 Fox 稳步前进，每次发布都能兑现承诺，真的很棒，不像有些模型总是画大饼。那這個模型为什么這麼厉害呢？主要是速度快，他們說這個模型的速度和效率都很出色，比今年夏天发布的第一版 Flux 快多了，生成速度更快，延迟更低，工作流更高效。 Fox 1.1 Pro 在图像质量和推理速度之间找到了完美平衡。你知道吗？以前用 stable diffusion 的时候调参数可费劲了，想要又快又好真不容易。但最大的新闻是 Flux 1.1 Pro，比现在的 Flux 快 3 倍。而且最小版本的模型比上一代的小模型快了 6 倍。我觉得还有一点很有意思，就是这些模型的性能到底指什么？因为生成图像模型的性能跟视频模型或纯文本模型比起来意味着完全不同的东西。他们说， Flux 1.1 Pro 以蓝莓的代号在人工分析图像竞技场进行了测试。所以如果你在竞技场看到它，那就是这个模型没错了。基本上它超越了排行榜上的所有其他模型，获得了最高的整体 l 分数，这可真是太厉害了，这个分数综合考虑了效率、速度、延迟和整体能力。

说话人 1 
最酷的是 FLOX 1.1 Pro，轻松击败了 FLOX 1 Pro。还有其他一些闭源模型，比如 midjourney V6.1、 idiogram V1 和 Playground V3。说起 Dolly 3 HD 真有意思，它基本上已经不怎么有竞争力了。当然有它在里面也不错，不过看到开源模型遥遥领先，真是太棒了。成本也是一个很有意思的角度，看起来 Flux 1.1 在本地推理时可能是计算成本最低的模型之一。这主要是看计算资源，还有他们新推出的 BF l API，这意味着如果你的产品需要这种功能，用它可能是最合适的。所以很酷的是，虽然這是開源模型，但如果用專業的集中式的方式托管，效果其实很棒。

说话人 1 
再看看 LO 分数，真的是太棒了。 Flux 1.1 Pro 完全碾压了所有竞争对手，包括它自己的上一个版本。最有意思的是 Flux 1.1 Pro 的速度还比 Flux Echnell 快很多。后者是它们提供的小一点的模型，接下来几周还会有一些很酷的新功能。

说话人 1 
其中一个大的更新是快速高分辨率生成这个功能我们在 stable diffusion 3 Turbo 的某些版本和一些修改版本中看到过，但最酷的是他们说这个功能会原生支持快速的超高分辨率生成，很快就会加入API，不过可能还不会加到模型里，可以生成高达 2K 分辨率的图像，而且不会影响提示词的效果。

说话人 1 
最棒的是，在发布当天，你就可以在 together a i 上用这个模型了。还有 replicate PHL 和 Freepic BFL API 的端点和使用方法跟其他 API 差不多，没什么特别的。当然它在可扩展性方面有些很酷的特性，但最大的亮点是定价。这可能是他们在开发模型的同时赚点收入的好办法，这或许能回答大家的疑问，他们打算怎么把这些成果变现？毕竟我们都知道 stability AI 最后就是没找到赚钱的方法。对了，他们还在招人，如果你想找工程师或其他岗位，一定要联系他们，我会在视频描述里放链接的。

说话人 1 
好，我们来看看 replicate 上的 Flux 1.1 Pro。我一直觉得 replicate 是最有意思的 API 平台之一，他们的设计很独特， GPU 基础设施也做得很棒。当然这可能是因为我认识 replicate 的人，不过说真的，我要试点高级的东西，我要加一些UN，必须要有这个。我要输入终端，屏幕上显示 Fox 1.1 秒 Pro 苏联时代蒸汽朋克潜水艇，地铁 2033 风格。

说话人 1 
我还挺好奇它用的是什么GPU，可能就是它们常用的应该是 A100 replicate，基本上都用A100S，有意思。好吧，看来没生成终端屏幕，那我再试试绿色音及射线管终端屏幕。很有意思，它还加了个人物，不过整体很协调。可能是我给的参考太多了，比如地铁2033，让它有点混乱，不过这看起来可能是潜水艇里的某个舱室。我们确实看到了阴极射线管终端，上面写着 Flex 1.1 Pro，整体还是很有苏联风格的，你看那些座位什么的，窗户里透进来的光。嗯，这可能不太像潜水艇了，不过看起来还是很酷。我再是最后一个完全不同的提示，这次不要文字，我要说云端世界青道负号飞船在长途探索后降落。

说话人 1 
哇，这个效果真的很惊艳，虽然我们没看到降落点，但我们得到了一艘非常有意思的宇宙飞船，背景也很漂亮，整个画面平衡得很好，这是很多开源模型以前一直有问题的地方，就是怎么平衡主体，怎么平衡背景，让整体看起来很nice，而且不会有哪部分特别突兀。

说话人 1 
我觉得 Midjourney 在理解你想要什么，或者你希望主体是什么，这方面还是有点问题的。這可能會很有意思，现在我們有了一個非常靠谱的開源模型，可以几乎完美地处理文字，而且不需要特别强大的GPU，这真是太让人兴奋了。当然，我们还在期待黑森林实验室接下来会带来什么，希望最终能看到他们那个超厉害的 AI 视频模型，现在我们只是看到了一些开始的碎片，可能是生成视频帧的部分，但很快就会看到他们更多精彩的成果，真是让人期待啊。我还会做几个视频，聊聊这个话题，比如哪些 GPU 最适合跑这个模型，我觉得怎么部署这个模型最好，我也迫不及待想看到黑森林实验室的下一次更新。快在评论区告诉我你的想法，你是不是也很想试试这个模型？还是你更喜欢继续用midjourney，我总是很想听听你们的看法，如果喜欢我们的内容，别忘了点赞、订阅和分享哦，我们下期再见了。

# Flux如何生成更高质量图片的提示词
文生图模型Flux因其出色的图像生成质量和对提示词的高遵循度而受到广泛关注。

但是大家自己写的提示词，通常生成质量都一般，所以如何生成高质量的Prompt成为关键。

以下通过一些样例来作为指导，让大家都能生成更高质量的内容

例子：一个漂亮的亚洲女人

应该如何丰富这个基础框架？人物的脸部描述，衣服描述，背景描述，整体风格描述...可以把这些要求输入给AI，让它帮忙补全和转成英文

Prompt: A beautiful Asian woman with long flowing hair, wearing a traditional hanfu dress, standing in a cherry blossom garden, soft pastel colors, elegant and serene, digital painting, high resolution

以下是对提示词各部分的解释：

A beautiful Asian woman: 指定人物的美丽和种族特征。

with long flowing hair: 描述她的发型。

wearing a traditional hanfu dress: 指定她的服装风格，汉服是一种传统的亚洲服饰。

standing in a cherry blossom garden: 提供背景环境，樱花花园增添了一种特定的氛围。

soft pastel colors: 指定整体色彩风格，柔和的粉彩色通常与柔美和女性化相关联。

elegant and serene: 描述人物的气质和情感表达。

digital painting: 指定艺术风格，数字绘画通常意味着更现代和清晰的图像。

high resolution: 指定图像的清晰度。

以上为蓝本将以上内容输入给Chage GPT， Claude，Kimi都可以，这些大模型文本理解能力差不多。然后我打算将背景做更丰富的描述，我输入以下prompt：

以下是一个文生图描述语句的prompt：A beautiful Asian woman with long flowing hair, wearing a traditional hanfu dress, standing in a cherry blossom garden, soft pastel colors, elegant and serene, digital painting, high resolution。以此为基础描述，我想要你再丰富描述背景的信息，让背景更加令人惊叹。

以下是chatGPT的返回，是把背景信息写的十分详细

Prompt: A beautiful Asian woman with long flowing hair, wearing a traditional hanfu dress, exuding elegance and grace. She stands amidst a sprawling cherry blossom garden, where the delicate pink blossoms create a breathtaking canopy overhead. The garden is set against the backdrop of ancient Chinese architecture, with intricately carved pavilions and tranquil ponds reflecting the blooming trees. A gentle breeze stirs the fallen petals, which dance through the air like a soft rain of color. The scene is bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun, casting a golden hour light that enhances the serene atmosphere. The soft pastel colors of the blossoms and the dress harmonize perfectly, creating a picturesque scene of natural beauty and cultural heritage. The image is a high-resolution digital painting that captures every detail with photorealistic precision, from the subtle texture of the fabric to the intricate patterns on the hanfu and the gentle ripples on the pond's surface.

# Prompt Crafting Techniques
Note: All examples were created with the FLUX.1 Schnell model from GizAI’s AI Image Generator.

1. Be Specific and Descriptive
FLUX.1 thrives on detailed information. Instead of vague descriptions, provide specific details about your subject and scene.

Poor: “A portrait of a woman”
Better: “A close-up portrait of a middle-aged woman with curly red hair, green eyes, and freckles, wearing a blue silk blouse”

Example Prompt: A hyperrealistic portrait of a weathered sailor in his 60s, with deep-set blue eyes, a salt-and-pepper beard, and sun-weathered skin. He’s wearing a faded blue captain’s hat and a thick wool sweater. The background shows a misty harbor at dawn, with fishing boats barely visible in the distance.



2. Use Artistic References
Referencing specific artists, art movements, or styles can help guide FLUX.1’s output.

Example Prompt: Create an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh’s “Starry Night,” but replace the village with a futuristic cityscape. Maintain the swirling, expressive brushstrokes and vibrant color palette of the original, emphasizing deep blues and bright yellows. The city should have tall, glowing skyscrapers that blend seamlessly with the swirling sky.



3. Specify Technical Details
Including camera settings, angles, and other technical aspects can significantly influence the final image.

Example Prompt: Capture a street food vendor in Tokyo at night, shot with a wide-angle lens (24mm) at f/1.8. Use a shallow depth of field to focus on the vendor’s hands preparing takoyaki, with the glowing street signs and bustling crowd blurred in the background. High ISO setting to capture the ambient light, giving the image a slight grain for a cinematic feel.



4. Blend Concepts
FLUX.1 excels at combining different ideas or themes to create unique images.

Example Prompt: Illustrate “The Last Supper” by Leonardo da Vinci, but reimagine it with robots in a futuristic setting. Maintain the composition and dramatic lighting of the original painting, but replace the apostles with various types of androids and cyborgs. The table should be a long, sleek metal surface with holographic displays. In place of bread and wine, have the robots interfacing with glowing data streams.



5. Use Contrast and Juxtaposition
Creating contrast within your prompt can lead to visually striking and thought-provoking images.

Example Prompt: Create an image that juxtaposes the delicate beauty of nature with the harsh reality of urban decay. Show a vibrant cherry blossom tree in full bloom growing out of a cracked concrete sidewalk in a dilapidated city alley. The tree should be the focal point, with its pink petals contrasting against the gray, graffiti-covered walls of surrounding buildings. Include a small bird perched on one of the branches to emphasize the theme of resilience.



6. Incorporate Mood and Atmosphere
Describing the emotional tone or atmosphere can help FLUX.1 generate images with the desired feel.

Example Prompt: Depict a cozy, warmly lit bookstore cafe on a rainy evening. The atmosphere should be inviting and nostalgic, with soft yellow lighting from vintage lamps illuminating rows of well-worn books. Show patrons reading in comfortable armchairs, steam rising from their coffee cups. The large front window should reveal a glistening wet street outside, with blurred lights from passing cars. Emphasize the contrast between the warm interior and the cool, rainy exterior.



7. Leverage FLUX.1’s Text Rendering Capabilities
FLUX.1’s superior text rendering allows for creative use of text within images.

Example Prompt: Create a surreal advertisement poster for a fictional time travel agency. The background should depict a swirling vortex of clock faces and historical landmarks from different eras. In the foreground, place large, bold text that reads “CHRONO TOURS: YOUR PAST IS OUR FUTURE” in a retro-futuristic font. The text should appear to be partially disintegrating into particles that are being sucked into the time vortex. Include smaller text at the bottom with fictional pricing and the slogan “History is just a ticket away!”



8. Experiment with Unusual Perspectives
Challenging FLUX.1 with unique viewpoints can result in visually interesting images.

Example Prompt: Illustrate a “bug’s-eye view” of a picnic in a lush garden. The perspective should be from ground level, looking up at towering blades of grass and wildflowers that frame the scene. In the distance, show the underside of a red and white checkered picnic blanket with the silhouettes of picnic foods and human figures visible through the semi-transparent fabric. Include a few ants in the foreground carrying crumbs, and a ladybug climbing a blade of grass. The lighting should be warm and dappled, as if filtering through leaves.



Advanced Techniques
1. Layered Prompts
For complex scenes, consider breaking down your prompt into layers, focusing on different elements of the image.

Example Prompt: Create a bustling marketplace in a fantastical floating city.

Layer 1 (Background): Depict a city of interconnected floating islands suspended in a pastel sky. The islands should have a mix of whimsical architecture styles, from towering spires to quaint cottages. Show distant airships and flying creatures in the background.

Layer 2 (Middle ground): Focus on the main marketplace area. Illustrate a wide plaza with colorful stalls and shops selling exotic goods. Include floating platforms that serve as walkways between different sections of the market.

Layer 3 (Foreground): Populate the scene with a diverse array of fantasy creatures and humanoids. Show vendors calling out to customers, children chasing magical floating bubbles, and a street performer juggling balls of light. In the immediate foreground, depict a detailed stall selling glowing potions and mystical artifacts.

Atmosphere: The overall mood should be vibrant and magical, with soft, ethereal lighting that emphasizes the fantastical nature of the scene.



2. Style Fusion
Combine multiple artistic styles to create unique visual experiences.

Example Prompt: Create an image that fuses the precision of M.C. Escher’s impossible geometries with the bold colors and shapes of Wassily Kandinsky’s abstract compositions. The subject should be a surreal cityscape where buildings seamlessly transform into musical instruments. Use Escher’s techniques to create paradoxical perspectives and interconnected structures, but render them in Kandinsky’s vibrant, non-representational style. Incorporate musical notations and abstract shapes that flow through the scene, connecting the architectural elements. The color palette should be rich and varied, with particular emphasis on deep blues, vibrant reds, and golden yellows.



3. Temporal Narratives
Challenge FLUX.1 to convey a sense of time passing or a story unfolding within a single image.

Example Prompt: Illustrate the life cycle of a monarch butterfly in a single, continuous image. Divide the canvas into four seamlessly blending sections, each representing a stage of the butterfly’s life.

Start on the left with a milkweed plant where tiny eggs are visible on the underside of a leaf. As we move right, show the caterpillar stage with the larva feeding on milkweed leaves. In the third section, depict the chrysalis stage, with the green and gold-flecked pupa hanging from a branch.

Finally, on the right side, show the fully formed adult butterfly emerging, with its wings gradually opening to reveal the iconic orange and black pattern. Use a soft, natural color palette dominated by greens and oranges. The background should subtly shift from spring to summer as we move from left to right, with changing foliage and lighting to indicate the passage of time.



4. Emotional Gradients
Direct FLUX.1 to create images that convey a progression of emotions or moods.

Example Prompt: Create a panoramic image that depicts the progression of a person’s emotional journey from despair to hope. The scene should be a long, winding road that starts in a dark, stormy landscape and gradually transitions to a bright, sunlit meadow.

On the left, begin with a lone figure hunched against the wind, surrounded by bare, twisted trees and ominous storm clouds. As we move right, show the gradual clearing of the sky, with the road passing through a misty forest where hints of light begin to break through.

Continue the transition with the forest opening up to reveal distant mountains and a rainbow. The figure should become more upright and purposeful in their stride. Finally, on the far right, show the person standing tall in a sunlit meadow full of wildflowers, arms outstretched in a gesture of triumph or liberation.

Use color and lighting to enhance the emotional journey: start with a dark, desaturated palette on the left, gradually introducing more color and brightness as we move right, ending in a vibrant, warm color scheme. The overall composition should create a powerful visual metaphor for overcoming adversity and finding hope.



Tips for Optimal Results
Experiment with Different Versions: FLUX.1 comes in different variants (Pro, Dev, and Schnell). Experiment with each to find the best fit for your needs.

Iterate and Refine: Don’t be afraid to generate multiple images and refine your prompt based on the results.

Balance Detail and Freedom: While specific details can guide FLUX.1, leaving some aspects open to interpretation can lead to surprising and creative results.

Use Natural Language: FLUX.1 understands natural language, so write your prompts in a clear, descriptive manner rather than using keyword-heavy language.

Explore Diverse Themes: FLUX.1 has a broad knowledge base, so don’t hesitate to explore various subjects, from historical scenes to futuristic concepts.

Leverage Technical Terms: When appropriate, use photography, art, or design terminology to guide the image creation process.

Consider Emotional Impact: Think about the feeling or message you want to convey and incorporate emotional cues into your prompt.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Overloading the Prompt: While FLUX.1 can handle complex prompts, overloading with too many conflicting ideas can lead to confused outputs.

Neglecting Composition: Don’t forget to guide the overall composition of the image, not just individual elements.

Ignoring Lighting and Atmosphere: These elements greatly influence the mood and realism of the generated image.

Being Too Vague: Extremely general prompts may lead to generic or unpredictable results.

Forgetting About Style: Unless specified, FLUX.1 may default to a realistic style. Always indicate if you want a particular artistic approach.

Conclusion
Mastering FLUX.1 prompt engineering is a journey of creativity and experimentation. This guide provides a solid foundation, but the true potential of FLUX.1 lies in your imagination. As you practice and refine your prompting skills, you’ll discover new ways to bring your ideas to life with unprecedented detail and accuracy.

Remember, the key to success with FLUX.1 is balancing specificity with creative freedom. Provide enough detail to guide the model, but also leave room for FLUX.1 to surprise you with its interpretations. Happy creating!
